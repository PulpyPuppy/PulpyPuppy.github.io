# OpenGL Implementation for RTEMS

Welcome to the somehow-central hub for the **PortableGL on RTEMS** project. I aim to update and upgrade the graphics capabilities of RTEMS introducing support of PortableGL library.

## Key Objectives

1. **Package Porting:** Obviously
2. **RSB Integration:** Official packages and build sets for the RTEMS Source Builder.
3. **Provide Demos:** A collection of examples from basic primitives to complex'ish scene.
4. **Documentation:** Comprehensive guide to start building GUI-rich applications.

## Current Progress

- [x] Initial RSB configuration for PortableGL 0.99.0.
- [x] Successful build for `i386/pc386` BSP.
- [ ] Development of the RTEMS Framebuffer binding (Work in Progress).
- [ ] Integration of the demo suite.
